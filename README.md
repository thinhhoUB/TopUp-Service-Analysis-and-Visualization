# TopUp-Service-Analysis-and-Visualization

## Problem and Objective:
-----------------------
MoMo, a leading e-wallet service provider, relies heavily on its Mobile Topup (Topup) service for a significant portion of its user base and revenue. However, to maintain its competitive edge and sustain growth, MoMo needs to continuously optimize and enhance its Topup service. Despite its importance, the Topup service faces various challenges and opportunities that require careful analysis and strategic planning.

Approaching the problem, I tend to focus these areas:

#### Revenue Optimization: 
Maximize MoMo's revenue generated from the Topup service by identifying and capitalizing on revenue-generating opportunities, such as optimizing commission structures and implementing targeted promotional campaigns.

#### User Engagement and Retention:
Enhance user engagement and retention within the Topup service by understanding user demographics, preferences, and behavior. This includes attracting new users, retaining existing users, and encouraging repeat transactions.

#### Service Performance Tracking:
Develop a comprehensive performance-tracking dashboard to monitor key metrics related to the Topup service on a monthly basis. This dashboard will provide actionable insights into service performance, transaction volume, revenue trends, and user demographics.

#### Strategic Decision Making:
Provide actionable insights and recommendations to key stakeholders, including the Marketing department, based on data-driven analysis of user behavior, transaction patterns, and market trends. This will enable informed decision-making and the development of effective strategies to drive the growth and success of the Topup service.

#### Evaluation of Proposed Changes:
Assess the potential impact of proposed changes, such as increasing cashback for users in Telco merchants, on service performance and user satisfaction. Evaluate whether these changes align with MoMo's business objectives and provide recommendations for their implementation.
